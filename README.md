## WARNING WARNING WARNING ADDON IS NOT AVAILABLE ON CHROME WEB STORE - ANYTHING YOU SEE THERE UNDER THAT NAME IS FAKE

## Installation

### Firefox

Sadly, official stable Firefox does not support custom addons, or setting custom addon collection. However, you have whole three choices as an alternative for normal Firefox!

You can install one of the following instead of normal Firefox:

-   [Firefox Beta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox_beta&hl=en&gl=US)
-   [Firefox Nightly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.fenix&hl=en&gl=US)
-   [Fennec (Available only on F-Droid)](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/)

After installing one of these browsers, follow these instructions:

1. Go to browser settings - go to `About Firefox` (or `About Fennec`, if you installed Fennec).
2. Tap on Firefox or Fennec logo till you see `Debug menu enabled` toast.

3. Return back to settings, tap on `Custom Addon Collection`. Enter the following settings:

| Collection Owner (User ID) | `12492822`                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Collection name            | `Octo-s-Mobile-FF-Extension-Lis` |

4. Go to Addons, install OldLander
5. (optional) Install RES for infinite scrolling, night mode and other features.
6. (optional) Insta Old Reddit Redirect to block new version.

### Kiwi

Note: this is kinda unsupported, I don't use Chromium browsers.

Install addon .crx file from Releases tab.

I cant release it on official store due to the fact I can't pay the registration fee with any of my bank cards.
